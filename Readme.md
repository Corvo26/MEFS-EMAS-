## Description  
WeatherApp is a mobile application designed to display meteorological data retrieved from a database hosted on **Firebase**, which contains information collected by our sensors, along with data from an external weather source. The app processes these data to predict weather conditions for the next 1 to 6 hours using a complex algorithm that leverages covariance and variance for accurate forecasting. Access is restricted to authenticated users through a secure login system.
